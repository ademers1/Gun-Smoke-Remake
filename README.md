# Gun-Smoke-Remake

This was originally a remake for one of my Unity classes during Toronto film school however I have refactored a bunch of the code and addded a bunch of new features since graduating. 

There are currently 4 Guns. 
Base Gun, Shotgun, Machinegun and Magnum as well as a smartbomb which gives you an extra life when you get hit. 

Controls.
Press x to shoot right z to shoot left and both to shoot forward. Find the hidden wanted poster and reach the end of the level. No boss has been added as of yet but stay tune.
